# Top Gun Audio

To complete the "Top Gun: Maverick" experience:

1.  **Find/Download** the "Top Gun Maverick Anthem" or "Danger Zone" MP3.
2.  **Rename** the file to: `maverick_anthem.mp3`
3.  **Place** it in the `public` folder of this project.
4.  **Refresh** the page!

*Note: I cannot automatically download copyrighted music for you, but the code is now wired up to play it as soon as you drop the file in!*
